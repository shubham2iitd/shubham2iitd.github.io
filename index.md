## Shubham Akshat

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Operations Management at the Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland. I am grateful to Dr. S. Raghavan for serving as my dissertation chair. My vision is to develop and apply Operations Management methodologies for promoting fairness and equity among the grassroots population to bring about a positive impact. I plan to advance, integrate and use research methods in econometrics, industrial organization, integer programming, probabilistic models, machine learning, and related fields to pursue my mission.

My dissertation focuses on the healthcare sector, liver allocation policy in the United States (U.S.) in particular. The goals of my thesis are to: (1) Understand why previous allocation policies have resulted in huge geographic inequities; and (2) Propose new policies that address the issue of geographic inequity and result in efficient allocations.

I will be on the 2021-22 academic job market.

I am presenting two talks at the INFORMS Annual Meeting 2021:

1. <em>"Does Broader Sharing Improve Patient Outcomes? An Analysis of The Share 35 Liver Allocation Policy"</em>: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/10390/session/1342">Session VWD13 - Health Care, Strategy and Policy</a>, October 27, 2021, 2:45 PM-4:15 PM
2. <em>"Continuous Scoring Model for Fair Liver Transplant Allocation"</em>: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/10390/session/1336">Session VTD13 - Health Care, Modeling and Optimization III</a>, October 26, 2021, 2:45 PM - 4:15 PM

I will be available for interview at any time and will attend the upcoming INFORMS Annual Meeting in person.
