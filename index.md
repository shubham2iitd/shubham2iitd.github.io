## Shubham Akshat

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Operations Management at the Robert H. Smith School of Business, University of Maryland. I am grateful to Dr. S. Raghavan for serving as my dissertation chair. My vision is to develop and apply Operations Management methodologies for promoting fairness and equity among the grassroots population to bring about a positive impact. I plan to advance, integrate and use research methods in econometrics, industrial organization, integer programming, probabilistic models, machine learning, and related fields to pursue my mission.

My dissertation focuses on the healthcare sector, liver allocation policy in the United States (U.S.) in particular. The goals of my thesis are to: (1) Understand why previous allocation policies have resulted in huge geographic inequities; and (2) Propose new policies that address the issue of geographic inequity and result in efficient allocations.
